#Stick-it

This is the prototype for an anonymous posting system of short, removable messages, developed as a learning exercise by cantrellnm.

To-do:

* refactor, clean up Angular template
* create a user system that links posts to users on server end, but not visible to users
* create database to store deleted posts for some period of time before permanent deletion
* create a report system for posts, another database to store those posts that need admin attention
* create system for making new public and private boards
